# **RESTAURANT TIPS ANALYSIS**

## ***Introduction***
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.

The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.

It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

As you can see each observation represents a customer who left a tip at a restaurant. We can see information about:

- the day it occurred
- if it was at lunch or dinner
- the total bill
- the sex of the person
- if they were a smoker or not
- the size of the party

It is clear that the maximum of smokers in the restaurant is 10, while the minimum is 1. The result also shows the mean number of smoked people is nearly 3.01 and the median is 3.

In contrast, analysis of the dataset reveals that the maximum number of non-smokers was 9, while the minimum was 1. Additionally, the mean number of non-smokers was approximately 3, and the median was 2.74. 

In conclusion, the number of people who smoke in a restaurant is higher than non-smokers.
